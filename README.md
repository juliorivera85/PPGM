niche modeling

For detail read:

Rivera, Lawing, and Martins (2020) Reconstructing historical shifts in suitable habitat of Sceloporus lineages using phylogenetic niche modeling. Journal of Biogeography.

This is an R analysis that allows you to reconstruct suitable habitat for a species in North and Central America from 1 to 20 million years ago at 1 MY increments.

The main code is called script_PPGM_JR and there are various smaller piecies of code that need to be sourced in a file called source_function

I've also included code to run an ancestral reconstruction of the climate variables along the phylogeny within teh PPGM code. Then you can find the phylogenetic signal of that climate variable.

Last, there is code to  run an LTT analysis. 

I've inluded the paleocliamte values in a Rdata file called paleoclimate. You don't have to modify this.
